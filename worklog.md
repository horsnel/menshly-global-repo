Task: Fix Briefing Room 404, nav menu, and article routing

Work Log:
- Investigated Briefing Room 404 — found hugo.toml had `[[enu.main]]` typo instead of `[[menu.main]]` for Entertainment & Finance nav items
- Verified via `od -c` hex dump that the actual bytes are correct `[[menu.main]]` — terminal display artifact
- Removed empty `theme = "paper"` line since theme submodule dir was empty
- Discovered ai-newsroom section had `date: 2026-04-17` (future date) causing Hugo to skip rendering the section list page entirely
- Fixed `content/ai-newsroom/_index.md` date to 2025-01-01
- Fixed both article dates from 2026 to 2025 to ensure rendering
- Backdated `scripts/auto-generate.py` by 1 hour to prevent future cron articles from being skipped
- Removed `functions/api/live-videos.js` (video player cancelled by user)
- Verified: Briefing Room returns 200, nav shows Entertainment + Finance, homepage excludes ai-newsroom articles

Stage Summary:
- Briefing Room: FIXED (was 404 due to future-dated _index.md, now 200 OK)
- Nav menu: Entertainment and Finance items restored
- Article routing: auto-generated articles stay in ai-newsroom section only
- All changes pushed to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages deployed successfully
